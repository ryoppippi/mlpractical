    "In the previous tutorial we introduced the tensorflow framework and some very basic functionality that it can provide. In this tutorial we will present a far more readable and research oriented tensorflow based code-base that allows one to quickly build new model architectures and research experiments in tensorflow. The proposed code-structure has been tested in real research and has proven a very readable and easily modifiable setup. "
